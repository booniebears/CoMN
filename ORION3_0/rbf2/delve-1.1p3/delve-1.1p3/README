Where can I get Delve?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The primary source is via the World Wide Web (WWW) from
http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~delve It can also be obtained via  anonymous
ftp from the machine "ftp.cs.utoronto.ca" in the directory
"/pub/neuron/delve". 

How to contact us
------------------------------------------------------------------------
We can be reached at delve@cs.toronto.edu. There is also an electronic 
mailing list for users of delve; to join the list, send a request to
delve-request@cs.utoronto.ca

 What is Delve?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Delve --- Data for Evaluating Learning in Valid Experiments --- is a
 collection of datasets from many sources, and an environment within
 which this data can be used to assess the performance of procedures
 that learn relationships using such data.

 Many procedures for learning from empirical data have been developed
 by researchers in statistics, pattern recognition, artificial
 intelligence, neural networks, and other fields.  Learning procedures
 in common use include simple linear models, nearest neighbor methods,
 decision trees, multilayer perceptron networks, and many others of
 varying degrees of complexity.  Comparing the performance of these
 learning procedures in realistic contexts is a surprisingly difficult
 task, requiring both an extensive collection of real-world data, and
 a carefully-designed scheme for performing experiments.

 The aim of Delve is to help researchers and potential users to assess
 learning procedures in a way which is relevant to real-world problems
 and which allows for statistically-valid comparisons of different
 procedures.  Improved assessments will make it easier to determine
 which learning procedures work best for various applications, and
 will promote the development of better learning procedures by
 allowing researchers to easily determine how the performance of a new
 procedure compares to that of existing procedures.

 Getting started
------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The Delve distribution is available via the world wide web (WWW) from
 the site http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~delve For those without WWW access
 it is  also available via  anonymous ftp from the machine
 "ftp.cs.utoronto.ca" in the  directory "/pub/neuron/delve". 
 In cases where both these options are unavailable, it may be possible
 to get  Delve (8 mm exabyte) tape media from us (send mail to
 delve@cs.toronto.edu).

 Three components of delve are available via ftp (and of through our WWW
 page): 

 1) doc - Detailed documentation. Available in single and souble column
 format.
 2) software - Tar files of the software referred to in the documention.
 Instructions for building and installing the software are given below.
 3) data - Tar files of data sets in the Delve collection. The list of
 datasets is constantly growing.

 The final component of Delve, the learning methods submitted to delve,
 is only available through the WWW page.


 Requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To build and install the delve utilities you must first have installed
Tcl (Tool Command Language) version 7.3 or higher.  The software is
available from the following sites:

	http://www.smli.com/research/tcl/

For more information on Tcl, you can check out The Santa Cruz
Operation database of Tcl/Tk Web pages. 

	http://www.sco.com/Technology/tcl/Tcl.html

It has links to just about everything imaginable on the Web that's
related to Tcl or Tk, including mirror sites for the Tcl distribution.


 Installation (See Appendix A in the Delve manual)
------------------------------------------------------------------------


  1) Obtain the latest software distribution and some datasets and
  methods.  The preferred method for retrieving these is via the WWW at
  http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~delve However in the following
  illustartion, we show how these can be obtained via ftp This
  illustration is for version 1.0 of the software, replace the "1.0"
  in delve-1.0 by the version that you wish, see "Version numbers" below.


	ftp ftp.cs.utoronto.ca
	cd /pub/neuron/delve
	binary
	cd software
	get delve-1.0.tar.gz	# Replace "1.0" by the latest version available

  2) Uncompress and untar the distribution:

	gunzip delve-1.0.tar.gz
	tar xvf delve-1.0.tar

  3) Run the configuration script:

	cd delve-1.0
	./configure

     or, for systems that don't recognize "#!" in shell scripts:

	cd delve-1.0
	/bin/sh ./configure

     By default, the configuration script will set things up to be
     installed in "/usr/local".  You can change this by specifying a
     different "prefix" in the "configure" command:

        ./configure --prefix=/your/install/path

     You can also add options for a particular "cc" compiler and
     compiler flags:

        ./configure --with-cc=gcc --with-cflags=-g

     For a full list of the options "configure" takes, type:

	./configure --help

     The "configure" script generates new Makefiles from their
     respective templates (Makefile.in).

     If "configure" can't find something, you can make changes to the
     intermediate "config.status" script, and invoke this script to
     reconfigure the Makefiles:

        vi config.status
        ./config.status

     As a last resort, you can edit the Makefiles in the current
     directory and "doc/" by hand and insert the proper paths.

  4) Build the libraries and the executables.  From the toplevel
     directory type:

        make all

  5) Install the executables, libraries, documentation, and script
     files.  From the top-level directory type:

        make install

     If you have problems, you can also use a subset of the commands:

	make install-binaries
	make install-libraries
	make install-doc
	make install-man

  6) Now that you have built and installed the Delve utilities, you
     can install the datasets and methods. The preferred method for
     obtaining datasets and methods is via the WWW at
     http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~delve  You need only
     retrieve those datasets and methods that you are interested in. In
     the following example we assume that you have downloaded the "demo"
     dataset and the basic linear regression method "lin-1" 

     Installing datasets and methods means simply extracting the files
     from their tar achives into your "delve" directory. By default this
     director is "/usr/local/lib/delve", but if you specified a
     "--prefix" to the "configure" command (setp 3 above), then replace
     "/usr/local" with that directory. In fact datasets and methods can
     be installed anywhere, see appendic C in the delve manual.

	mv demo.tar.gz /usr/local/lib/delve/data/
	cd /usr/local/lib/delve/data
	zcat data-boston.tar.gz | tar xvf -
	mv lin-1-all.tar.gz /usr/local/lib/delve/methods/
	cd /usr/local/lib/delve/methods
	zcat lin-1-all.tar.gz | tar xvf -


 Version numbers
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each Delve release is identified by two numbers separated by a dot,
e.g.  1.0 or 3.2.  If a new release contains changes that are likely
to break existing results or specification files then the major
release number increments and the minor number resets to zero: 2.0,
3.0, etc.  If a new release contains only bug fixes and compatible
changes, then the minor number increments without changing the major
number, e.g. 1.1, 1.2, etc.  If you datasets or results that work with
release X.Y, then they should also work with any release X.Z as long
as Z > Y.

Alpha and beta releases have an additional suffix of the form a2 or b1.
For example, Delve 1.0b1 is the first beta release of Delve version 1.0,
Delve 1.0b2 is the second beta release, and so on.  A beta release is an
initial version of a new release, used to fix bugs and bad features before
declaring the release stable.  An alpha release is like a beta release,
except it's likely to need even more work before it's "ready for prime
time".  New releases are normally preceded by one or more alpha and beta
releases.  We hope that lots of people will try out the alpha and beta
releases and report problems.  We'll make new alpha/beta releases to fix
the problems, until eventually there is a beta release that appears to
be stable.  Once this occurs we'll make the final release.

We can't promise to maintain compatibility among alpha and beta releases.
For example, release 1.1b2 may not be backward compatible with 1.1b1, even
though the final 1.1 release will be backward compatible with 1.0.  This
allows us to change new features as we find problems during beta testing.
We'll try to minimize incompatibilities between beta releases, but if
a major problem turns up then we'll fix it even if it introduces an
incompatibility.  Once the official release is made then there won't
be any more incompatibilities until the next release with a new major
version number.
