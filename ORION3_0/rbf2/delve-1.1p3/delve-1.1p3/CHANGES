----------------- Released 1.0a1, 96/05/17 -----------------------

96/05/28 (internal change) Replaced calls to all Extended Tcl commands
with calls to equivalent Tcl, or Unix commands (with the exception of
'random') (dvc).

96/05/29 (internal change) Changed all C level calls to TclX 'handle'
routines to use Tcl 'Hash Table' routines instead (dvc).

96/05/30 (feature change) Changed dinfo, dls, etc. to no longer check
if the 'Dataset.data' file exists.  This may not be wise, but it
allows people to delete it if disk space is scarce (dvc).

96/05/30 (feature change) Attributes ranges can now have lists of
ranges (dvc).

96/06/03 (bug fix) If the full path to the installation directories
doesn't exist, non-existent parent directories are created (dvc).

96/06/03 (feature change) Mloss now computes the Z loss only for tasks
with all categorical or integer targets (dvc).

96/06/03 (feature change) Mgendata no longer creates the 'targets.i'
or 'test.i' files if there are no target values or input values
respectively (dvc).

96/06/03 (bug fix) Cleaned up the formatting of the input and target
attributes produced by dinfo and minfo when the lists of attributes
are empty (dvc).

96/06/04 (feature change) Added pseudo-random number generator based
on a general lagged Fibonnacci generator using subtraction (dvc).

96/06/05 (bug fix) Fixed bug in Delve file unlinking command
'funlink': now it doesn't die if the list of files to delete is empty
(dvc).

96/06/05 (feature change) Removed all remaining TclX dependencies from
Makefiles, configure scripts etc. (dvc).

96/06/05 (new feature) Added '-d' flag for all scripts: Aids
debugging by printing stack traces when an error occurs.  Only works
for Tcl version 7.5 or higher (ignored for earlier versions) (dvc).

96/06/05 (feature change) Changed dls so that it assumes that it's
printing output to a tty if it can't be sure it isn't (dvc).

96/06/10 (bug fix) Fixed bug where mgendata attempted to calculate
normalization statistics for input attributes, even when there were no
real/integer attributes in the list (dvc).

96/06/10 (feature change) Changed mloss so that 'S' and 'A' loss are
only allow for tasks with all real or integer targets, and 'Z' loss is
only allowed for tasks with all integer, ordinal, nominal, or binary
targets (dvc).

96/06/10 (new feature) Added an optional field for the Dataset.spec
file: "title".  It has a default value of "no title", and is displayed
by both dinfo and minfo (dvc).

96/06/10 (bug fix) Changed so that mloss doesn't overwrite a loss or
guess file if the corresponding guess or cguess file is garbled (dvc).

96/06/11 (feature change) Changed the format of the 'Test-set-stats'
file so that it now contains statistics with the math already
performed on them, plus new keywords so that the values have
semi-meaningful names.  The new file format allows us to add new
statistics without breaking older versions (dvc).
*** INCOMPATIBILITY with Delve 1.0a1 ***

96/06/12 (new feature) Added normalization of loss statistics
calculated using the zero one loss and the squared probability loss
measures (dvc).

96/06/12 (new feature) Added normalization of loss statistics
calculated using the negative log probability loss for categorical
target attributes (dvc).

96/06/13 (feature change) Changed the thermometer coding to always use
n-1 values where the first value in the range is encoded as all
negative numbers (i.e. changed to always assume the first value is
passive).  Also changed to allow scaling of the values in the encoding
by the a function of the number of values in the attribute's range.
By default values are now scaled by sqrt(n-1) (e.g. what used to
encode as "-1 -1 1" would now encode as "-0.57735 -0.57735 0.57735")
(dvc).
*** INCOMPATIBILITY with Delve 1.0a1 ***

96/06/13 (feature change) Changed 'mgendata' to allow specifification
of any number of cases for testing, some of which may however be
thrown away in order to make all the test sets for a given task be the
same size.  We also now allow the number of cases remaining for
training to *not* be a multiple of all the training set sizes (again,
trailing cases are thrown away) (dvc).

96/06/14 (bug fix) Fixed a bug in 'acdc_delete' that caused *all*
attribute encodings to be deleted if you tried to delete just one.
This meant that mgendata could break if you tried to run it over an
entire prototask directory (dvc). 

----------------- Released 1.0, 96/06/14 -----------------------

96/06/25 (bug fix) Fixed bug in normalizeLossStats for 'L' loss
measure in compare mode.  First expected loss wasn't being normalized
at all (dvc).

96/06/25 (new feature) Added '--with-cc' and '--with-cflags' options to
the configure script so users can over-ride the default C compiler and
flags (dvc).

96/06/25 (bug fix) Fixed various routines in the path module that
generated errors if data or method directories were empty by adding
'-nocomplain' to the glob command (dvc).

---------------- Released patch 1.0p1, 96/06/25 ----------------


(1 Oct 1996 Mike takes over administration of Delve)

1 Oct 96 (new feature) Compressed files handling. Many of Delve's files can
be left in compressed form and they will be uncompressed 'on the fly' provided
there exists an uncompression utility that can write to stdout. Currently .Z
.z .gz and .zip are recognized extensions (But I dont know of a utility that
can handle .zip files) (mr)

1 Nov 96 (new feature) -v option added to dinfo to report the current
software version number. Also dinfo now  reports the total number of cases at
the dataset level. (mr)

21 Nov 96 (bug fix) in mstats. Gracefully handle situation in which estimated
variances of expected performance difference is zero (Print p= undefined) (mr)

23 Nov 96 (bug fix) Encoding in mgendata. Fixed situation of encoding with a
passive=value, where value contains an '=' sign, eg passive=<=50. (mr)

5 Dec 96. (new feature) dinfo reports the task types found in a dataset. It
does it by examining the prior information (type) of the task targets. (mr)
---------------- Released version 1.1, 6 Dec 1996 ----------------

8 Jan 97 (bug fix) The DELVE_UNCOMPRESS environment variable was not being
read properly (library/utils.tcl)

---------------- Release patch 1.1p1 9 January 1997 ----------------------

28 Jan 97 (added feature) Make dinfo -v report patch level in addition
to delve version number

22 Apr 97 (bug fix) The attribute list was not being cleared between task
generations. This resulted in Coding-used files containing extra attributes
when  multiple tasks were generated with mgendata. Changes in acdc.tcl and
taskGen.tcl

22 Apr 97 (Feature enhancement) Make the reporting of errors more meaningful
in for_file (utils.tcl

11 June 97 (bug fix) The 22 Apr bug fix introduced another bug - cleared
attributes that are loaded from an encoding file. Fixed this by clearing
attributes directly in mgendata.

---------------- Release patch 1.1p2 11 June 1997 ----------------------

22 November 1997 Fixes to make compatible with tcl version 8.*
tcl_precision, some configuration changes for dynamic loadable libraries
and making sure integer calculations return integers

---------------- Release patch 1.1p3 27 November 1997 ----------------


September 1997 Added suport for client-server version - Delve server running
on would extend the 'delve path system' unreleased version 1.2
