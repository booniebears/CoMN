Sorted by priority

For version 1.0
===============

- nothing

For version 1.1
===============

- Modify "mstats" so that it can generate "loss" files from "cguess" etc,
  on the fly, without having the "Test-set-stats" files
  explicitly around. (Difficult)

- Write the "mtable" and "mcheck" scripts. (Difficult)

- In the dataset specification files the "missing value indicator" "?"
  should be allowed. (Moderate to difficult).

- Implement censored values. (Difficult)

- Implement attribute '0', the index of the case (Moderate).

- Implement sequential prototasks and stratification. (Moderate)

- Implement commonality indices. (Difficult)

- Implement non-standard task instances. (Moderate)

- Allow invertible operations (like log(x), exp(x) and 
  squeeze(x)=sign(x)*log(1+|x|)) on attributes in the
  Prototask.spec files. (Difficult)

- make 'loss.Z' files contain '0' or '1', not '0.0 and '1.0'. This is
  probably not important; in the case where more than on target attribute
  is to be predicted the average (or will it be sum?) loss may not be
  integer. (Easy, but is this really desirable?)
